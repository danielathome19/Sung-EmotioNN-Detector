TBA

**NOTE:** these folders should be placed in the **same** folder as "main.py". For folder existing conflicts, simply merge the directories.

In main.py, the "fmain" function acts as the controller for the model, where calls to train the model, create a prediction, **TBA**, and all other functions are called. One may also call these functions from an external script ("from main import wavsplit", etc.).

To choose an operation or series of operations for the model to perform, simply edit the main function before running. Examples of all function calls can be seen commented out within main.
